# Supermark-simulation
Objective : "Write a C program to simulate the working of a supermarket division that handles perishable items. Keep track of the inventory and its expiry date and handle items that are expired/ sold."

This was a 2nd year data structures college project. I had to use heap data structure to go about the problem statement. The end product was to make a terminal/ command prompt menu based application. 

I designed my project in a way which lets the user simulate going to the next day.
Once that happens, the expiry amount on each item reduces by 1. 
Note: All the items are hardcoded. Automating that would have deviated me from the main purpose of the project.
